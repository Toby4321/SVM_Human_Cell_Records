# SVM_Human_Cell_Records
In this notebook, you will use SVM (Support Vector Machines) to build and train a model using human cell records, and classify cells to whether the samples are benign or malignant.
Set the working directory to the directory where your cell_samples csv file is stored. This involves modifying this line in the code: "pd.read_csv(r"D:\Data\cell_samples.csv")"
